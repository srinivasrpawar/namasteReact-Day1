1   What is First Class Function ?
    In Javascript, functions are first class functions objects.
    First class functions means when functions in that language are trated like any other variable
    for Example: a function can be passed as an argument to other function and can be assigned as a value to a variable
     
     const run = ()=>{
        //logic
     }
     run();// invoke it using a variable

2   What is Higher Order Function ?
    A function that returns another function as an argument or returns a function as a return value or both is called Higher order function

    const data =[1,2,4];
            data.map(function(d)=>{
                console.log(d);//1,2,4
            });

    here map is a Higher order function because its other function as argument


3   What is Callback Function ?
    A Callback function is a function that is passed as an argument into another function and then invoked 
    inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action

    const data =[1,2,4];
     data .map(function(d)=>{
        console.log(d);//1,2,4
     });

     here, inner function is a Callback function  because its passed a argument to other function

4   What is Currying Function ?
    -It is a process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument
    -Currying is named are greet to improve code reusability and functional composition

    function calculateVolume(length){
        return function(breadth){
            return function(height){
                return length * breadth * height;
            }
        }
    }
    console.log(calculateVolume(2)(4)(2));// 16

5   What is Pure Function ?
    -A pure function is a function whre the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects
    -If you call a function with same argument its will always return the same result.

    const add =(x,y)=>x+y;
    add(2,4); // 6

6   What is Arrow Function (=>) ?
    -Arrow function is one of the features introduced in the es6 version of javascript.
    -It allows you to create function in a cleaner way compared to regular functions.
    -Arrow funcions dont have their own bidings to this,arguments,or super 

    cosnt add =(x,y)=>{x+y};
    add(2,4);//6

7   What is Anonymous Function ?
    Anonymous is a function that does not have any name associated with it.
    Normally we use function keyword  before the function name to define a fucntion in javscript,
    however in Anonymous funtion keyword without the name

    var greet =function (){
        console.log("pawar is super cool now to learn javascript");
    }
    greet();

8   What is IIFE Function ?
    -An IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
    -IIFE is a javascript function that runs as soon as it defined.
    -You can use IIFEs to prevent global variables defination issues alias variable protect private data, avoid conflicts of many librabries
    that export the same object name;
