1   What is First Class Function ?
    In Javascript, functions are first class functions objects.
    First class functions means when functions in that language are trated like any other variable
    for Example: a function can be passed as an argument to other function and can be assigned as a value to a variable
     
     const run = ()=>{
        //logic
     }
     run();// invoke it using a variable

2   What is Higher Order Function ?
    A function that returns another function as an argument or returns a function as a return value or both is called Higher order function

    const data =[1,2,4];
            data.map(function(d)=>{
                console.log(d);//1,2,4
            });

    here map is a Higher order function because its other function as argument


3   What is Callback Function ?
    A Callback function is a function that is passed as an argument into another function and then invoked 
    inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action

    const data =[1,2,4];
     data .map(function(d)=>{
        console.log(d);//1,2,4
     });

     here, inner function is a Callback function  because its passed a argument to other function

4   What is Currying Function ?
    -It is a process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument
    -Currying is named are greet to improve code reusability and functional composition

    function calculateVolume(length){
        return function(breadth){
            return function(height){
                return length * breadth * height;
            }
        }
    }
    console.log(calculateVolume(2)(4)(2));// 16
